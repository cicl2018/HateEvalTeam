# HateEval - Task 5 - EleniTeam

In this repository we are going to upload all data files and share all codes that we develope.</br>

<b> Tasks </b>

<b>TASK A</b> - Hate Speech Detection against Immigrants and Women: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to   predict whether a tweet in English or in Spanish with a given target (women or immigrants) is hateful or not hateful.

<b>TASK B </b> - Aggressive behavior and Target Classification: where systems are asked first to classify hateful tweets for English and Spanish (e.g., tweets where Hate Speech against women or immigrants has been identified) as aggressive or not aggressive, and second to identify the target harassed as individual or generic (i.e. single human or group).
